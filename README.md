To launch the Weather-Scrapper application, open a browser and navigate to `https://www.weather-forecast.com/locations/{city}/forecasts/latest`, replacing `{city}` with the city you would like to view the forecast for (e.g. "London", "New-York", etc). You can also navigate to the base URL `https://www.weather-forecast.com`, and from there you can search for your location in the search box located in the upper right corner of the page.</br></br>
